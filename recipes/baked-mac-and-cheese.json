  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Butter a large baking dish.",

    "Combine shredded cheddar, provolone, and gruyere in a bowl and set aside.",
    "Melt both butters (42g unsalted + 42g salted) together in a large saucepan.",
    "Whisk in the flour over low to medium heat and cook until it bubbles and turns lightly golden.",
    "Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream until smooth. Keep whisking until the mixture begins to bubble.",
    "Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Add two cups of the shredded cheese mixture and whisk until smooth.",
    "Add the rest of the shredded cheese and whisk until the sauce becomes very creamy.",
    "Stir in the cooled macaroni until everything is well coated.",
    "Pour half of the mac and cheese into the prepared baking dish.",
    "Sprinkle part of the panko topping over the first layer.",

  "notes": [
    "Volume to weight conversions are approximate: 2 tbsp olive oil ≈ 28g, 4 heaping tbsp flour ≈ 40g, 1.5 cups panko ≈ 90g, 4 tbsp butter ≈ 56g",
    "Total butter used: 84g for sauce + 56g for topping = 140g",
    "For best results, shred cheese fresh rather than using pre-shredded"

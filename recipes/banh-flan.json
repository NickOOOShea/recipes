  "steps": [
    "Make caramel: Heat sugar, water, and lemon juice in a small saucepan over medium heat. Meanwhile, prepare a large bowl of iced water.",
    "Once caramel turns amber (about 3-5 minutes), remove from heat and place saucepan into iced water for 10 seconds. Be careful not to splash water into caramel.",
    "Pour or spoon caramel into 6 molds (about 150ml each). Leave to harden.",
    "Make custard: Whisk eggs in a medium bowl and set aside.",
    "Put milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt in medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar dissolves.",
    "Continue heating until mixture reaches 70°C (158°F).",
    "Preheat oven to 150°C (300°F).",
    "Remove milk from heat. Slowly add eggs through a strainer while mixing.",
    "Strain mixture again, then pour into molds over the hardened caramel.",
    "Place a tea towel on workbench. Tap molds on towel a few times to remove air bubbles.",
    "Cover each mold with aluminum foil. Poke a few holes through the foil.",
    "Place a tea towel in bottom of baking tray. Put molds in tray.",
    "Fill tray halfway up the molds with medium-hot tap water (not boiling).",
    "Bake for 35 minutes.",
    "Remove molds from tray and cool for 10 minutes at room temperature.",
    "Carefully remove foil. Let cool until cool enough to handle.",
    "Cover each mold with cling wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably 1-2 days for best results).",
    "To serve, run a knife around edges and turn upside down on a plate. Caramel will spill over custard."

  "notes": [
    "Volume conversions: ¾ cup sugar ≈ 150g, 3 tbsp water ≈ 45g, 1 tsp lemon juice ≈ 5g, 5 eggs ≈ 250g, 600ml milk ≈ 600g, 1 tsp vanilla ≈ 5g, 1 pinch salt ≈ 1g",
    "Requires 6 molds of roughly 150ml each",
    "Chilled and set after 4 hours, but caramel may not be fully liquefied - 1-2 days gives best liquid caramel",
    "Smooth, soft custard with slightly bitter dark amber caramel that balances sweetness",

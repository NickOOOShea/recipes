    "This template works for virtually all tares. It gives you a tare with umami and salt because it uses salt and MSG, and nothing else.",
    "On its own it adds minimal complexity; we want to highlight the qualities of the soup with shio tare, not add to it.",
    "You can use approximately 10% salt in your tare, and 6% ingredients containing glutamic acid. All shio tares can be built around these ratios.",
    "Stores indefinitely in the fridge.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

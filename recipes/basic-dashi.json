  "steps": [
    "Add the cold water and kombu to a pot (if using niboshi or shiitake, add with the kombu).",
    "Heat over medium-low heat until just below simmer, around 80°C.",
    "Turn off the heat and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu, add the katsuobushi (if using).",
    "Bring up to a simmer, then turn off the heat again, cover, and allow to steep until flavored to your liking, anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.",
    "Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed."

  "notes": [
    "This is an all-purpose dashi. If you're not sure where to start, this is a safe bet.",
    "Some variants suggest an overnight soak before cooking. To do this, combine the kombu (and niboshi or shiitake, if using) and water, place in the fridge for 12-24 hours before cooking, then proceed with step 2.",
    "Dashi degrades quickly in flavor, so it only keeps for a few days in the fridge.",
    "Can be used to thin out thick soups or as part of the 'double soup' technique.",

  "steps": [
    "MAKE DULCE DE LECHE: Heat sous vide bath to 185°F (85°C). Submerge unopened can of sweetened condensed milk and cook for 4 hours. Let cool before opening.",
    "PREP: Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C) with rack in center for at least 30 minutes. Line a 9x13 inch metal pan with parchment paper, extending up the short sides. Spray with non-stick spray.",
    "Sift flour and cocoa powder together twice. Set aside.",
    "MELT CHOCOLATE: Set up a bain marie (bowl over simmering water at 160-170°F). Add chopped chocolates and diced butter. Stir occasionally until fully melted, about 10 minutes. Keep warm over the water.",
    "MAKE ITALIAN MERINGUE: Add sugar to a small pan, pour water around the sides. Insert probe thermometer. Cook over medium heat to 248°F (120°C) hardball stage.",
    "When syrup is 10°F from target, start whipping eggs on high speed until doubled and pale yellow.",
    "When syrup reaches 248°F, remove from heat. With mixer running, slowly pour syrup in a thin stream into the eggs (avoid the sides of the bowl).",
    "Whip for 15 minutes until cooled slightly and meringue has structure.",
    "COMBINE: Turn mixer to low. Slowly drizzle in the warm melted chocolate. Scrape bowl and mix until incorporated.",
    "Add vanilla, kosher salt, and miso paste. Mix for 1 minute.",
    "Add the sifted flour-cocoa mixture. Mix on low for 2 minutes, scrape bowl, mix another minute until homogenous.",
    "ASSEMBLE: Pour 1/3 of batter into prepared pan, smooth out. Drizzle 1/3 of dulce de leche in stripes and swirl with a skewer. Sprinkle chocolate chunks over top.",
    "Pour remaining batter on top. Drizzle more dulce de leche and swirl. Finish with Maldon flake salt.",
    "BAKE: Bake 48-50 minutes until internal temp is 195-200°F (91-93°C), or until toothpick comes out with moist crumbs (not wet). The center will dome then collapse when done.",
    "Cool for at least 2 hours before slicing. Use parchment edges to lift brownies from pan."

  "notes": [
    "Called Billionaire Brownie because it's obscenely rich.",
    "White miso adds a mellow umami that balances the sweetness - don't skip it.",
    "The Italian meringue technique creates the dense fudgy interior and glassy crackly top.",
    "Dulce de leche: sous vide at 185°F - 4 hours for caramel, up to 12 hours for darker/thicker.",
    "For gluten-free: substitute bread flour with Otto's Cassava Flour (brand matters).",
    "Use a metal pan for crispy edges. Glass or ceramic pans need 10-15 extra minutes.",
    "Keep melted chocolate above 100°F or it will thicken and ruin the glassy top."

    "When ready, heat the contents to 71°C/160°F, hold for 10 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu and discard.",
    "Bring the contents to a boil.",
    "Add the MSG and Molasses, whisking to dissolve.",
    "Remove from heat and allow the tare to cool and steep, at least 30 minutes (though you can steep for much longer).",
    "Strain out the mushrooms, pressing on the solids to extract as much as possible. Reserve the tare as needed."

  "notes": [
    "This recipe is derived from 'Toyama Black' style ramen. The original technique popularized in the region involves boiling down soy sauce until it is heavily concentrated.",
    "This recipe accommodates this by using soy sauces that are overtly black in color from the get go, avoiding issues with balance.",
    "Resulting soups are intensely pigmented but complex. Look for Chinese soy sauces that are syrupy and deeply colored.",
    "Hold in the fridge for up to 6 months.",
    "Add 35 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

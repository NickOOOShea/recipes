  "notes": [
    "Boiling spinach is not hard, and it's also a common topping, particularly in shoyu ramen.",
    "Since the soup is often amply seasoned, the water used for cooking here does not need salt.",
    "Feel free to add salt to the cooking water if you choose.",
    "The quick cooking time preserves the color and texture of the spinach.",
    "Shocking in ice water stops the cooking process and sets the bright green color.",
    "Wringing out excess water prevents diluting the ramen soup.",
    "Shaping into a log makes for uniform, attractive 2-inch pieces."

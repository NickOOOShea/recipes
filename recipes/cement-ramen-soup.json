  "steps": [
    "Combine medium-sized niboshi and kombu, cover with 2 L water, place in the fridge to soak overnight (This overnight soak helps save time over traditional dashi. You can also follow the dashi method shown).",
    "Soak pork bones in water overnight.",
    "Take soaked pork bones, discard soaking water, and add to new water in a pot. Bring to high heat and blanch to remove scum, around 5-10 minutes at a rolling boil.",
    "Strain, discard blanching liquid. Cover with 4 L of new water. Boil for 18 hours.",
    "After 18 hours, add aromatics and boil for 1 hour.",
    "Strain. You should have around 2-3 L.",
    "Add steeped niboshi and kombu mix to strained soup. Bring to a boil. At 80°C/176°F, discard kombu.",
    "Reduce heat to lowest on the stove, simmer the niboshi for 1 hour.",
    "Strain soup, reserving niboshi.",
    "In a blender, blend the small niboshi to form a powder.",
    "Add reserved niboshi from step 9 to the powder-filled blender jar, and enough soup to cover (including as much un-emulsified fat as possible). Blend on high until grey/green slurry is formed. The niboshi should be quite soft at this stage.",
    "Add slurry back to the soup, mix to incorporate.",
    "Strain one more time to remove the residual pulp, pressing on pulp to achieve full extraction.",
    "Reserve soup until needed."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Despite the name, this style specifically refers to the greyish/greenish hue of the soup.",
    "The color comes from blending in whole niboshi and niboshi powder before straining.",
    "A popular but admittedly polarizing style, heavy on fish notes, and can be daunting.",
    "The soup is a fish lover's delight.",
    "The blended fish helps to stabilize the emulsion.",

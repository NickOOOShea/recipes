  "steps": [
    "Take your pork belly or shoulder, and toss it into your simmering/boiling broth. Tie it, keep it loose, whatever you like.",
    "Add the pork to the broth when it begins to bubble, and after you've skimmed any scum.",
    "Cook in the broth until tender, anywhere from 2-3 hours.",
    "Remove the pork when you feel it is sufficiently cooked. For a melty piece of meat, the internal temperature should reach around 203°F (95°C), though anything above 190°F (88°C) will be very tender.",
    "Place in the Easy Meat Shoyu Tare, and allow to soak in the fridge for 2-4 hours."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "This method requires very little setup and no additional pots needed.",
    "It adds flavor to the soup.",
    "Cannot add salt before cooking.",
    "Typically the most boring flavor-wise compared to other methods.",
    "Prone to overcooking.",
    "This seasons the pork, your tare, AND adds porky goodness to your soup.",
    "Some styles, like Jiro ramen, hinge on this approach.",
    "Can be beneficial for tonkotsu, which needs fat and collagen to achieve the proper soup look and feel.",
    "Use a meat thermometer to check doneness - 203°F (95°C) for melty texture."

  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F).",
    "On a baking sheet with a wire rack set in it, add the pork belly and season generously with salt and pepper.",
    "Roast until the interior of the meat reaches 91°C (195°F), anywhere from 5-10 hours depending on the size of the roast.",
    "Remove the pork, increase the heat of the oven to 230°C (450°F).",
    "When the oven has come to the higher temperature, coat the pork in the glaze, and roast for 5-10 minutes or until caramelized and seared to your liking."

  "notes": [
    "Despite the name 'chashu' roughly referring to Chinese roast pork, the actual act of dry roasting chashu is relatively rare.",
    "In some shops, the pork is hung in a small chimney like charcoal or gas grills until it is cooked.",
    "Precaution needs to be taken to avoid over-cooking the meat.",
    "Unlike water-based cooking where temperature never gets above boiling, dry roasting can quickly overcook portions of the meat.",
    "Chashu needs to be roasted at a lower temperature for a very long time, upwards of 5-6 hours.",
    "Meat cooked this way is never tender the way a braised piece of meat is.",
    "Has deep, intense, caramelized notes on the exterior of the meat.",
    "Excellent aroma and crust.",
    "Familiar technique to most cooks.",
    "Messy, unable to add certain flavors, prone to overcooking.",
    "The method is effectively the same for pork belly or shoulder."

  "steps": [
    "Preheat a water bath to 79°C (175°F) using a sous vide water circulator.",
    "Sear the pork belly on all sides on high heat in a pan until golden brown, then place in a sturdy bag (ideally one used for a vacuum sealer).",
    "Deglaze the pan with the sake, then add mirin, soy sauce, water, and brown sugar. Reserve this liquid and allow it to cool.",
    "When the liquid has cooled, add it to the bag with the pork.",
    "Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible.",
    "Cook the pork belly sous vide for 7-12 hours.",
    "Remove the meat from the bath, and add to the ice water to chill quickly.",
    "Reserve in the fridge until needed, then slice as desired."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Sous vide is an incredible tool for chashu.",
    "Produces meat that is both exceptionally tender, well structured, and gorgeously pink, while still being fully cooked and safe to eat.",
    "Most high-end shops are pivoting to this approach because it allows them to cook with marvelous consistency.",
    "You can store the pork in the bag well in advance before use.",
    "Simply remove the bag from the water bath, chill in ice bath, then reserve in the fridge.",
    "The pork should keep well for several weeks in the vacuum-sealed bag, as it will be pasteurized and won't be exposed to oxygen.",
    "You can select many temperatures and times based on preference.",
    "For a more steaky, firm chashu, use lower temperatures (68°C/155°F) for a longer period (24-36 hours).",
    "The cooking liquid is practically identical to what's used in the braising recipe.",
    "Most control, most consistent product, great color, consistent flavor.",
    "Most time consuming and equipment can be expensive."

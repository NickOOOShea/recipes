    "In a microwave-safe bowl like Pyrex, add your chicken skin.",
    "Cook uncovered for 8 minutes at high power. You may wish to check on it to ensure it doesn't splatter.",
    "Strain and reserve the skins. They won't be crispy at this stage.",
    "To make the skins crispy (optional), pop them back into the microwave without the strained fat for a few more minutes.",
    "If not using the fat immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Microwave method is easier than stovetop and less prone to developing roasted or cooked flavors in the skin.",
    "Microwaving provides a better yield than the stovetop method.",
    "Use a microwave-safe bowl like Pyrex.",
    "Store in the fridge for up to 6 months.",
    "You can also use the fat that renders out of chicken skin while making soup, which contributes collagen to the soup."

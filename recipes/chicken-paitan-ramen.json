  "steps": [
    "Preheat your serving bowl by placing it in a 170°F (77°C) oven, or by filling it with hot water.",
    "Prepare all toppings and have them ready (slice chashu, halve eggs, slice green onions).",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil for cooking the noodles.",
    "Heat the Chicken Paitan Soup to a simmer.",
    "When ready to assemble, empty the preheated bowl and add the Lighter Shoyu Tare or Soy/Shio Blend Tare (30g) to the bottom of the bowl.",
    "Add the Chicken and Scallion Oil or Chicken Fat (15g) to the bowl - you can use both oils if desired for extra richness.",
    "Add the hot Chicken Paitan Soup (300g) to the bowl and stir to combine the tare and oil.",
    "Cook the Makeshift-Hakata Style Noodles (130g) in the boiling water according to the noodle recipe instructions.",
    "When noodles are done, immediately drain them thoroughly in a fine mesh strainer, shaking vigorously to remove excess water.",
    "Add the drained noodles to the bowl of soup. Use chopsticks to separate and arrange the noodles if desired.",
    "Add toppings: place chashu at 6 o'clock position, egg at 11-12 o'clock, green onions in the center, and nori at 1-2 o'clock (add nori last as it gets soggy quickly).",
    "Serve immediately while hot."

    "Component recipes needed: chicken-paitan-soup, lighter-shoyu-tare or soy-shio-blend-tare, chicken-and-scallion-oil or chicken-fat-stovetop or chicken-fat-microwave, makeshift-hakata-style-noodle",
    "Prepare all component recipes in advance before assembly.",
    "Paitan refers to a white, creamy soup made by emulsifying chicken bones and fat through vigorous boiling.",
    "Unlike tonkotsu (pork bone), paitan uses chicken for a lighter but still rich and creamy broth.",
    "You can use either chicken and scallion oil, pure chicken fat, or a combination of both for the aroma oil.",
    "Work quickly when adding noodles to prevent them from becoming sticky or overcooked.",
    "30 mL of tare equals approximately 30g, 15 mL of oil equals approximately 15g, 300 mL of soup equals approximately 300g."

  "steps": [
    "Add the chicken parts and water to a pot.",
    "Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising.",
    "Cook at a medium boil for 6 hours, stirring frequently, and adding water to ensure bones are covered.",
    "Add aromatics, boil thoroughly for one hour.",
    "Strain the soup.",
    "To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing. You can also use a hand blender for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won't be as strong.",
    "Reserve the soup as needed."

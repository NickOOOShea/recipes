    "Wash the clams and scrub their exteriors to remove any residual dirt on the outside.",
    "Combine 1 L cold water, sake, and cleaned clams in a pot.",
    "Heat over high heat until reaching a simmer.",
    "Cook the clams at a simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the shells have opened and the clams are completely cooked.",
    "Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed. You can then harvest the meat for alternative purposes."

  "notes": [
    "Clam ramen is becoming more popular - this dashi is clam forward with only 3 ingredients.",
    "This dashi can have additional dashi elements like katsuobushi or niboshi steeped in it after completion.",
    "Only keeps for a few days in the fridge.",
    "Can be combined with other soups to create complexity.",

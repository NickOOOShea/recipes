    "Cook different soup components separately (e.g., vegetable soup at specific temperature and time, meat soup at different conditions, dashi at different conditions).",
    "Chill each component thoroughly after cooking.",
    "When ready to serve, reheat and combine the separate soups in desired proportions.",
    "Adjust dilution by controlling the gelatin content of concentrated soups - either reduce water or increase amount of bones/chicken."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "A relatively new method emerging around the turn of the 2000s for combining separate soups just before serving.",
    "By cooking different ingredients separately and then combining, you have more control over the specific outcomes of each part.",
    "Main consideration is dilution - when combining dashi with meat soup, water increases dramatically, reducing final gelatin content.",
    "At home, this is mitigated easily by just combining all ingredients in one pot.",
    "Better suited for restaurants than home cooks - allows separation of complex tasks in busy kitchens and helps scale down soup volume.",
    "Rather than making a 40-quart singular pot, restaurants can make multiple smaller batches of concentrated soup, which are easier to strain and can be held cold, combined when needed.",
    "Example: Combining Chicken Soup (4 Brix) with Basic Dashi (0 Brix) in 2:1 ratio results in final soup of ~2.7 Brix due to dilution.",

    "Combine the soy sauce, mirin, and MSG in a container.",

    "Remove the chashu, use it for eating or other purposes.",
    "Store the tare in a sealed container."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Jiro ramen uses a pretty simple tare, where they take some cut of pork that is cooked in the broth and soak it in a sauce that eventually turns into tare.",
    "The meat seasons and can be used as chashu, and the sauce extracts some of the pork flavor while becoming the tare.",
    "This approach is super convenient, although the tare is a little sweet, so much that it isn't as applicable to other bowls.",
    "Store in sealed container for up to 2 months.",
    "Add 45 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

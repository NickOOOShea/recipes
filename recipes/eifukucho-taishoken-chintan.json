  "steps": [
    "Add the pork bones to a stockpot, cover with water.",
    "Bring up to a boil over high heat. When boiling, skim the scum that rises to the surface. Continue to boil until little to no scum remains, around 20 minutes.",
    "Turn the heat to low, and let the pork bones cook at a bare simmer (around 88°C/190°F), 7 hours.",
    "In the last hour, add all remaining ingredients, let steep for 1 hour at below simmer.",
    "Strain the soup and reserve until needed."

  "notes": [
    "Derived from Eifukucho Taishoken, a legendary ramen shop in Tokyo, one of the oldest continually operating shops in Japan.",
    "Indicative of old-school ramen from Tokyo, heavy with pork and fish products.",
    "Fish-forward soup with lots of vegetables and relatively low quantity of pork.",
    "Final soup is noticeably murky, but this is intentional - old school soups are not as clear as modern interpretations.",
    "Due to extremely high quantity of fish, a lower salinity tare or less tare overall is preferable. For 350 ml soup, use only 22 ml of the new wave tare.",
    "From 'The Book of Ramen' - Chapter 2: Soup"

  "steps": [
    "In the container you want to soak the eggs in, weigh your peeled soft boiled eggs. Add water until your eggs are completely covered, and record the total weight. For example, if you have 3 cooked and peeled eggs that weigh 150 grams, and to cover them completely you need to add 350 grams of water, you'll have 500 grams total.",
    "Add in 10% of the total weight you found as soy sauce, and 8% as mirin. In the example above, since your eggs and water weigh 500 grams, you'd add in 50 grams of soy sauce, and 40 grams of mirin.",
    "Soak in the fridge for at least 24 hours, and reserve in the brine until needed. Anywhere from 1-3 days, these will be excellent.",
    "After 5 days, chemistry starts to play more of a role. Anything longer than 5 days and the egg's exterior becomes soft and somewhat crumbly."

  "notes": [
    "Equilibrium brining is a technique commonly used to flavor proteins like chicken or pork, but rarely used for eggs.",
    "This technique treats the brine as the general flavor and salinity you want your brined item to be, not more or less.",
    "The equilibrium method takes the guesswork out of knowing when to pull the eggs and creates a consistent edge to edge seasoned egg with no grainy yolks.",
    "In this method, the egg white is uniformly seasoned throughout, and the yolk is lightly cured, firming into a clear and fully seasoned gel.",
    "These eggs will be ready anywhere from 1 to 4 days after being placed in the brine with no loss in quality.",
    "The only real downside is that you have to wait around 1-4 days.",
    "You just need a scale and patience for this method.",
    "Physics doesn't make exceptions - this method requires time for diffusion to occur."

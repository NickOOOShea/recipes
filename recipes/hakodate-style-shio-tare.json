  "steps": [
    "Soak the scallop, shrimp, and konbu in the water, for at least 6 hours and up to 24, in the fridge.",
    "When ready to make, add the dried products and water to a saucepot. Cook on medium heat until the cooking liquid registers at 160°F. Hold here for 5 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu and bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and cook for 30 minutes, covered.",
    "In a separate pot, add the sake and mirin, boil until the smell of alcohol has evaporated, around 5-10 minutes.",
    "Strain the konbu/seafood liquid into the pot with the sake. Discard the seafood.",
    "Add the MSG and Salt, bring to a boil to dissolve.",
    "The final yield should be 300 ml, add water back to get to this total amount."

  "notes": [
    "Arguably the originators of the shio style, Hakodate shops tend to lean into seafood's flavor, as the city is a port town.",
    "This one uses dried scallop and dried shrimp, but niboshi or bushi is also common.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

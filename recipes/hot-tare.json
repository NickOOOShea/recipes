  "notes": [
    "Designed for a spicy ramen that didn't pivot too directly into Miso flavors.",
    "Opting to use more Korean ingredients, the final tare has subtle pepper flavors and good heat, without overwhelming the specific flavor of the soup you're using.",
    "Reserve in the fridge for up to a week.",
    "Add 45 ml of tare per 300 mL soup."

    "The base recipe yields a few more tablespoons than needed - this is intentional so you have enough even when some gets left behind in the pan or container.",
    "DRY ICE ALTERNATIVE: Instead of an ice cream maker, use a KitchenAid mixer with paddle attachment. Drop pea-sized pieces of dry ice into the mixture while mixing on low until it reaches soft-serve consistency. Use gloves and work in a ventilated area.",
    "For blood pudding: The flavor is a heady mix of spices, cocoa, and cream cooked into real blood pudding. It carefully toes the line between delectable and frightful.",
    "Pig's blood can often be found frozen at Asian grocery stores or ordered from a butcher.",
    "For lavender: Use culinary-grade dried lavender (pesticide-free) from the spice shop or a specialty store.",
    "For goat cheese: Any fresh chevre will work. The amount of habanero is up to you - more heat makes the next lick of cold cream taste sweeter.",
    "Always fully thaw frozen base before using.",
    "For best texture, chill the base for 24 hours before churning."

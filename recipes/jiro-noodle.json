    {
      "name": "high protein bread flour (14%+ protein, 0.5+ ash)",
      "amount_g": 100,
      "amount_oz": 3.53

      "amount_g": 36,
      "amount_oz": 1.27
    },
    {
      "name": "powdered kansui (60% potassium, 40% sodium)",
      "amount_g": 1,
      "amount_oz": 0.04
    },

  "steps": [
    "Add kansui powder and salt to the water, dissolve completely. If using both sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them one at a time. Go slowly, stir constantly until clear. This will take a while, but eventually, the contents will dissolve. You can make the solution several days before to get a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight container.",
    "In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add flours. Turn the mixer to \"stir\" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix.",
    "While running the mixer on stir, add two thirds of your water mixture slowly, in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 5 minutes.",
    "Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for 3-5 more minutes, or until the crumbly dough does not leave flour residue on your hands when you touch it.",
    "Turn off the mixer and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close the bag, place it on the ground, and step on the dough to compress it into a flat sheet, then let this compressed dough rest in the closed bag, for one hour. This dough is low hydration and hard to work with without stepping on the dough, this jumpstarts some of the structure.",
    "Press the dough, taking portions of the dough from step 5 and, using an electric pasta machine, sheet the dough. Start with the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is smooth and not ragged.",
    "After pressing, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp for another 30-45 minutes to relax the gluten.",
    "Pull out your dough. Roll out to desired thickness with the pasta machine, using potato or cornstarch as you go to prevent sticking. Roll these to about 3 mm thick.",
    "Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. Given the above, use a 1.5 mm cutter, standard with a Marcato Atlas. At this thickness, the noodles will fray as they exit the cutters.",
    "Bundle the noodles into 180 g portions and place them in the sealable bag. Put the bag in the fridge and allow it to rest for at least a day."

  "notes": [
    "Jiro noodles are almost entirely made with a specific brand of flour from Nisshin Seifun Group called \"Ooshon\", a higher mineral flour with high protein content. King Arthur's High Gluten flour is a good substitute",
    "These are low hydration noodles (36%), making them difficult to work with at home. The original uses 33% hydration",
    "The resulting noodles will be a light tan hue",
    "Cut oblong using \"Reverse cut\" technique - rolling the dough wider than the openings of the cutters creates a frayed effect on the exterior that is good at picking up soup (but bad for the cutters, so don't do this often)",
    "Noodles will be extremely firm and will take a long time to cook",
    "This is a LOT of noodles per person (180g). Feel free to adjust as you like",
    "Rest in fridge for at least 1 day before use"

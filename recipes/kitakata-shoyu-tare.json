  "notes": [
    "This recipe comes from Shichisai, who uses extremely high-quality soy sauce that you or I probably don't have. Just use the best soy sauce you can buy, and blend accordingly.",
    "The steps itself are incredibly simple, but this tare is less flavor-forward than other shoyu tares due to the boil and additional salt content.",
    "Store in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

    "Combine the water, soy sauce, kombu, and niboshi in a sealed container.",
    "Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.",
    "Add the mixture to a small saucepan.",
    "Heat the contents to 71°C/160°F, hold for 10 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu and discard.",
    "Bring 180F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes.",
    "Add the katsuobushi, hold at 82°C/180°F for 5 more minutes.",
    "Strain and reserve liquid on the side.",
    "In a new clean pot, add your mirin, sake, brown sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 5 minutes.",
    "Add this mixture to your mixture from step 9."

  "notes": [
    "When you want to keep the color of the broth lighter in appearance, use this tare. It uses a light soy sauce (usukuchi soy sauce) in place of more commonly found dark soy sauce.",
    "It isn't as bold as a standard shoyu tare, but it has delicious subtle flavor elements and the color is lighter.",
    "Stores in the fridge for up to 6 months.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 350 mL soup."

    "Set sous vide cooker to 134.6°F (57.0°C).",
    "Using a tomato peeler or lemon zester, remove only the yellow peel from 10 lemons, avoiding the bitter white pith.",
    "Add lemon peel to high-proof grain alcohol. Divide 5 lemon peels into each 500ml jar of alcohol for optimal flavor extraction.",
    "Seal jars and immerse in the water bath for 3 hours while the lemon zest macerates.",
    "While macerating, prepare simple syrup by dissolving 1400g sugar in 2000g water. Boil for 2 minutes, then cool completely.",
    "After maceration, shake jars and cool to room temperature.",
    "Strain through coffee filters or cheesecloth, discarding peel.",
    "Divide the strained alcohol (approximately 333ml per bottle) into three clean 1-liter bottles.",
    "Fill each bottle to 1 liter capacity with simple syrup (about 666ml per bottle), resulting in 32% alcohol by volume.",
    "Keep in a cool, dark, dry place for several weeks before serving to allow flavors to develop."

  "notes": [
    "Volume conversions: 1 liter alcohol ≈ 1000g, 2 liters water ≈ 2000g",
    "Use organic lemons to avoid pesticides in the peel",
    "Do not use vodka - high-proof grain alcohol is essential",
    "Final product yields approximately 3 liters at 32% ABV",
    "Improves with age - wait at least a few weeks before drinking"

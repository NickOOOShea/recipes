  "steps": [
    "Bring half of the water (1660g / 7 cups) to a boil in a Dutch oven or large pot.",
    "Remove from heat and stir in sugar to dissolve.",
    "Drop in the tea bags and steep until the water is completely cooled (a few hours).",
    "Stir in the remaining water (1660g / 7 cups).",
    "Remove and discard tea bags. If using loose leaf tea, strain out the tea leaves.",
    "Stir in the pre-made kombucha.",
    "Pour the mixture into a clean 1-gallon or larger glass jar.",
    "With clean hands, gently place the SCOBY on top.",
    "Cover the mouth of the jar with a clean cotton dish towel, cheesecloth, or paper towels secured with a rubber band.",
    "Store at room temperature, out of direct sunlight, where jar won't get jostled.",
    "Ferment for 7-10 days. A new cream-colored SCOBY layer should form on the surface within a few days. Brown stringy bits, sediment, and bubbles are all normal.",
    "After 7 days, begin tasting daily. When it reaches a pleasant balance of sweetness and tartness, it's ready to bottle.",
    "With clean hands, gently lift the SCOBY out and set on a clean plate. If making another batch right away, measure out starter tea and set aside.",
    "Divide the diced mango between bottles.",
    "Pour fermented kombucha into bottles using a small funnel, leaving about 1 inch of head room.",
    "Seal the bottles and store at room temperature out of direct sunlight.",
    "Allow 1-3 days for carbonation. Plastic bottles will be rock-solid when carbonated; for glass bottles, open one intermittently to check.",
    "Once carbonated, refrigerate for at least 4 hours to chill.",
    "Strain the mango when serving if desired. Kombucha will keep refrigerated for several weeks."

  "notes": [
    "Volume conversions: 3½ quarts water = 3320g total (divided into two 1660g portions), 1 cup sugar ≈ 200g, 4 tea bags ≈ 1 tbsp loose leaf ≈ 8g, 2 cups kombucha ≈ 480g, 1 cup mango ≈ 150g",
    "Makes about 1 gallon",
    "Total time is approximately 10 days (7-10 days primary fermentation + 1-3 days carbonation)",
    "SCOBY may float at top, bottom, or sideways during fermentation - all positions are normal",
    "Thawed frozen mango works fine"

    "The night before, submerge the bamboo to a bowl of cold water and allow them to soak in the fridge for 12-24 hours.",
    "Drain the bamboo thoroughly, set aside.",
    "In a saute pan, add your bamboo, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce.",
    "Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is slightly absorbed, 10-15 minutes.",
    "Add the sesame oil to coat.",
    "Transfer the menma to a container and allow them to soak for 24 hours. The menma will keep over time."

  "notes": [
    "The reality is that menma in the US is hard to make.",
    "Menma requires a specific type of bamboo that has been dried and lacto-fermented.",
    "These are effectively unavailable to home cooks (though some restaurant distributors do sell them in bulk).",
    "If you can get your hands on these, the process is also somewhat annoying, but doable.",
    "Some asian supermarkets sell prepared menma.",
    "The author does not have a recipe they think is a sufficient substitute using canned bamboo at this time.",
    "Quick methods with canned bamboo exist but are not recommended by the author."

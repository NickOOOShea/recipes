  "steps": [
    "In a small saute pan, add the onion puree and cook with a small amount of oil over low heat, until golden brown, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, around 20-30 minutes.",
    "Remove the onion from the heat.",
    "In a separate large saute pan, toast the mulato, ancho, guajillo, and Chinese chilis over medium-high heat until fragrant, pliable, and starting to brown, around 3-5 minutes.",
    "Cut the heat, and add the water (or broth if using), cover, and let steep for 10-15 minutes, or until the chilis are soft and reconstituted. If your pan is hot, you might need to add more water.",
    "To the jar of a blender, add the contents from the saucepans in steps 2 and 3 with the remaining ingredients.",
    "Blend until the sauce has a uniform consistency. If the sauce is too thick, dilute with water as needed."

  "notes": [
    "This is a recipe developed for a popup at Ramen Lab. The team wanted something unique in addition to spicy.",
    "It has moderate heat, but complex chili flavors. It works excellently with chicken broth, or in tsukemen variants.",
    "The ingredient list may seem daunting but the process overall is quite simple.",
    "Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
    "Add 30g of tare per 350 mL soup, adding an additional 20 mL of soy sauce to the bottom of the bowl."

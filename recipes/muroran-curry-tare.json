  "steps": [
    "Toast the coriander, cumin, brown mustard seeds, black peppercorns, and cloves in a small saute pan for 1-2 minutes over medium heat, until aromatic.",
    "Grind the spices, then combine with the white pepper, cardamom, togarashi, cinnamon, turmeric, nutmeg, and curry powder. Set spice mix aside.",
    "Combine the onion, garlic, ginger, apples, and potato in a high-powered blender, blend into a fine puree. You may need to do this in batches.",
    "Add the puree to a large pot with a splash of vegetables. Bring to a simmer, then cover, drop the temperature to low, and cook for 1 hour, stirring regularly to prevent scorching. This mixture may turn blue as it cooks, this is normal and expected.",
    "Add the spices, salt, and MSG, cook for another hour. Continue to stir regularly.",
    "Transfer to an airtight container and store in the fridge until needed."

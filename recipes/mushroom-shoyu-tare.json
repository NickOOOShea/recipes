    "When ready, heat the contents to 71°C/160°F, hold for 10 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu and discard.",
    "Bring the contents to a boil.",
    "Add the sugar, whisking to dissolve.",

  "notes": [
    "For a vegan option, this variant is nice. The mushrooms contain guanylate, which helps improve the sensation of umami on the palate.",
    "A small addition of tamari helps round out the richness of the mushroom flavor, but is otherwise optional.",
    "Hold in the fridge for up to 6 months.",
    "Add 35 mL of tare per 350 mL soup."

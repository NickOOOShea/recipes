  "steps": [
    "Add kansui powder and salt to the water (and riboflavin if using), dissolve completely. If using both sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them one at a time. Go slowly, stir constantly until clear. This will take a while, but eventually, the contents will dissolve. You can make the solution several days before to get a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight container.",
    "In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add your flour and egg white powder. Turn the mixer to \"stir\" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix.",
    "While running the mixer on stir, add two-thirds of your water mixture slowly, in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 3 minutes.",
    "Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for another minute, until small clumps begin to form.",
    "Turn off the mixer, and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close, and let this rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Don't skip this.",
    "Knead it, by using an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is quite smooth and not ragged.",
    "After kneading, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp for another 30 minutes.",
    "Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes, and roll out to desired thickness, using potato or cornstarch as you go to prevent sticking.",
    "Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. 1.5 mm by 1.5mm is standard for these, though oblong, such as 2.0 mm by 1.5 mm is also nice.",
    "Bundle the noodles into 130 g portions and place them in a sealable bag. Put the bag in the fridge and allow it to rest for at least a day."

    "A modification on the Tokyo style noodle, using rice flour to achieve additional slipperiness and texture",
    "Suited well for Shoyu style broths",
    "If using powdered kansui, use 0.5 g sodium carbonate and 0.7 g potassium carbonate (around 40% sodium and 60% potassium)",
    "Rest in fridge for at least 1 day before use"

  "steps": [
    "In a large saute pan, sweat the onion over medium heat in the oil until translucent, 3-5 minutes.",
    "Increase the heat to high, and add in the pork. Cook, stirring and breaking up clumps, until starting to brown.",
    "Add in the garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant, around 1 minute.",
    "Add in remaining ingredients. Cook until the pork is glossy, fully cooked, and flavorful. Adjust seasonings as necessary."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Soboro is a common ramen topping in tantanmen.",
    "It's also great over rice, stuffed into lettuce wraps, or on its own with a spoon.",
    "Method modification: The above can be treated almost like a bolognese. Rather than cooking the ingredients, add them all to a dutch oven as-is, and place in a 177°C (350°F) oven and cook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally and scraping down brown bits. The resulting meat mixture is much more 'sauce' like in this application, and takes on notable roasted flavors.",
    "Adjust the heat level by adding chili paste or chili oil if desired.",
    "Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to a week.",
    "Can be frozen for longer storage."

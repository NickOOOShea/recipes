  "steps": [
    "Place peeled soft boiled eggs in an airtight container, like a hard plastic container or a sealable bag.",
    "Pour the soy sauce, mirin, and water into the container to cover (you may not need to use all the brine, reduce the amount as necessary).",
    "Soak, jostling contents every hour or so, for 4-6 hours.",
    "Remove from brine, reserve in the fridge until needed."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "This is the generally accepted approach for eggs in most Japanese kitchens.",
    "It's simple and doesn't require a lot of precision.",
    "Be sure to pull the eggs out after 4-6 hours to avoid over-saturating them in the brine.",
    "For 300 mL of brine, use 100 mL of each ingredient (one part each).",
    "The salt content in this brine is very high, and if left too long at equilibrium, would overseason the egg and destroy the proteins.",
    "This method works but may not season the egg as evenly as the equilibrium brine method."

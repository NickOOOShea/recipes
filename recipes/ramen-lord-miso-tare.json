  "steps": [
    "Take 70 g of the raw onion puree, and add to a small pan.",
    "Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, around 20-30 minutes.",
    "Remove from heat, place the cooked onion in a mixing bowl.",
    "When the onion has cooled, add all remaining other ingredients. Use a whisk to combine.",
    "Place in the fridge in a covered container and allow the tare to mature for at least 24 hours to better develop the flavor and remove some of the harshness from the raw vegetables."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "After more than 10 years of tweaking and experimenting with miso tare, this is Ramen_Lord's take. It's very miso forward.",
    "If you don't like your miso so forward in the flavor of the final dish, you can cook the tare in a saucepan or wok for 5-10 minutes over medium heat. Doing so releases volatile compounds in the miso.",
    "The tare will keep for up to 12 months.",
    "Add 60-70 g of tare per 300 mL soup."

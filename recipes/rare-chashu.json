  "steps": [
    "Using butcher's twine, tie the pork into a round shape.",
    "Coat the pork in the salt and sugar (use 2% of the roast's weight for each).",
    "Add white pepper and garlic powder as desired to form a full rub on the exterior. The roast is large, so you can often be aggressive with seasoning here.",
    "Place the meat in a zip lock bag, and place it in the fridge for at least 24 hours. Shake the bag as necessary to promote even cure.",
    "When ready to cook, preheat a water bath to 63°C (145°F) using a sous vide water circulator, or whichever temperature you prefer.",
    "Add the zip lock bag to the bath, removing air surrounding the pork. Use either a vacuum sealer or the water in the immersion circulator to push out the air before sealing the bag.",
    "Cook the pork for 6 hours.",
    "Remove the meat from the bath, place on a wire rack set in a sheet tray.",
    "Preheat your oven to 288°C (550°F), or as high as it will go.",
    "Cook the pork for 10-30 minutes, or until the exterior is charred, browned, and sizzling.",
    "Remove from the oven and allow to cool, then place in the fridge and allow to set and cool completely.",
    "Use a slicer to slice thin pieces, or a very sharp knife."

  "notes": [
    "Historically, most ramen used well done pork, but techniques like sous vide now allow for safely cooked rare pork.",
    "Chefs in Japan use sous vide to cook pieces of pork until they are just barely cooked, around 57-63°C (135-145°F).",
    "The texture is somewhere between steak-like and ham, and the color is very pink.",
    "The USDA has lowered the required temperature of pork products to 63°C (145°F).",
    "Food safety relies on temperature and exposure time - sous vide allows for control of both.",
    "It's a completely different product than well-done pork. Needs to be thinly sliced to account for the lack of collagen breakdown.",
    "Can quickly go from pink to grey if it sits in the hot soup for too long.",
    "Rare chashu typically uses leaner cuts of the animal, commonly the 'coppa' (also called 'the tubes', CT Butt, top of the shoulder, or pork neck muscle).",
    "The coppa is a section of the shoulder that runs furthest from the large bone and is heavily marbled with fat in between circular, tube-shaped muscle groups.",
    "Can be made from any cut of nicely marbled shoulder, but traditionally the tubes are used to get the quintessential round look.",
    "At Akahoshi, an overnight dry brine and a final roast results in chashu that is succulent and deeply flavored while retaining its rare appearance and texture.",
    "The odds of getting trichinosis is very low - the CDC reports less than 20 cases yearly."

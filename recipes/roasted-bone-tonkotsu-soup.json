  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 230°C/450°F.",
    "When heated, place the bones on a sheet tray, and roast for 45 minutes to an hour, turning the bones halfway, until they look brown and caramelized.",
    "Add the bones to a pot with water to cover. You may opt to also deglaze the roasting tray with more water, and add this water to the pot.",
    "Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.",
    "If using, add aromatics to the broth in the last hour.",
    "Strain the soup.",
    "To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing. You can also use a hand blender for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won't be as strong.",
    "Reserve the soup as needed."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Roasting the bones eliminates the need to skim and manage scum and funk in tonkotsu.",
    "The resulting broth is slightly darker than traditional tonkotsu, but blends to be quite creamy.",
    "Can be made in pressure cooker: Up to 2 hours at pressure.",
    "Can be stored for up to a week in the fridge or 6 months in the freezer.",

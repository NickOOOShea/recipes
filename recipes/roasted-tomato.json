    "Preheat your oven to 107°C (225°F).",
    "Slice the tops and bottoms off of the tomato, then slice the tomato in half lengthwise (so that you have two round, fat disks of tomato).",
    "Place the tomato on a baking sheet, season with salt, pepper, and drizzle with olive oil.",
    "Roast the tomatoes until they are plush, withered, and have shrunk in size, around 2-3 hours."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "This method is blatantly stolen from the legendary Ivan Orkin, who used this topping to great effect in his shio ramen in Japan.",
    "It's delicious, and a great alternative for an umami-laden ingredient.",
    "Roma tomatoes are recommended, but any tomato you like will work.",
    "The slow roasting concentrates the tomato flavor and creates a sweet, umami-rich topping.",
    "Great for adding complexity to lighter ramen styles, particularly shio ramen."

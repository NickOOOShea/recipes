  "notes": [
    "For some additional complexity, this tare uses kombu for flavor, as well as a few other sources of subtle aromatics.",
    "Sake contains trace amounts of glutamate, adding to the umami profile, as well as a variety of other aromatics as a result of the brewing process.",
    "Store indefinitely in the fridge.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

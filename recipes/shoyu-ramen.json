    "When ready to assemble, empty the preheated bowl and add the Standard Shoyu Tare (30g) to the bottom of the bowl.",
    "Add the Negi Niboshi Oil (20g) to the bowl.",
    "Add the hot Tokyo Style Chintan broth (300g) to the bowl and stir to combine the tare and oil.",
    "Cook the Tokyo Style Noodles (135g) in the boiling water according to the noodle recipe instructions (typically 1-2 minutes).",
    "When noodles are done, immediately drain them thoroughly in a fine mesh strainer, shaking vigorously to remove excess water.",
    "Add the drained noodles to the bowl of soup. Use chopsticks to separate and arrange the noodles if desired.",

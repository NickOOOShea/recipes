  "steps": [
    "Heat water to 176°F (80°C) using a sous vide machine. Make sure you have enough water in your cooking vessel to completely cover the jars.",
    "Beat the cream cheese and sugar together in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer at medium speed until fluffy and light.",
    "Add the eggs, one at a time. Beat until the mixture is well combined.",
    "Add sour cream, vanilla extract, salt, and lemon juice. Continue mixing until the cheesecake mixture reaches an even consistency without any lumps. Stop the mixer from time to time and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is evenly incorporated.",
    "Lay out 9 4-ounce jars. Scoop the cheesecake mixture into the jars leaving 1½ inches of room at the top of each jar. Tap the bottom of the jars a few times against a flat surface to shake out the air as much as possible from the mixture.",
    "Seal the jars tightly with your fingers only. Do not use the strength of your full hand to tighten the lids. Air needs to come out from the jars while sous vide cooking.",
    "Carefully lower the jars in the sous vide bath using tongs. Cook for 90 minutes.",
    "Once the timer is up, remove the jars carefully and allow them to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours to let it set completely before serving (ideally overnight).",
    "Make the crust: Place the graham crackers or digestive crackers in a zip-top bag and use a rolling pin to crumble them. In a medium skillet, melt butter over medium heat, add the crumbled crackers in the skillet to combine with the butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.",
    "Optional - make the blueberry topping: In the same skillet or a small saucepan, cook the blueberries with sugar and lemon juice over low heat. Bring to a slow simmer. Cook for 10-15 minutes, stir gently and occasionally, until the blueberries just start to break down and the mixture is thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until ready to use.",
    "Serve: Open a jar of cheesecake, add a generous spoonful of blueberry topping and a big spoonful of the loosened crust on top."

    "Soak the kombu in the mirin, sake, and white wine, for at least 6 hours and up to 24, in the fridge.",
    "When ready to make, add the kombu and steeping liquid to a saucepot. Cook on medium heat until the cooking liquid registers at 160°F. Hold here for 5 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu, boil slightly to remove some residual alcohol, around 5 minutes.",
    "Add the soy sauces and salts. Reserve this liquid on the side.",
    "In the now-empty pot, add the niboshi and sesame oil to a pot. Cook until fragrant on medium-high heat, around 40 seconds.",
    "Add the water, bring to 82°C/180°F.",
    "Add the katsuobushi and steep for 10 minutes.",
    "Strain this liquid, adding it to the one in step 4.",
    "Combine the two strained liquids."

  "notes": [
    "As mentioned earlier, some shio tare recipes contain soy sauce. This is one of them.",
    "It's effectively a blend of many tares, making it a great all-purpose tare for creamy soups and light soups alike.",
    "Store in the fridge until ready to use. Keeps for around 6 months.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

    "The author doesn't know whether this counts as a 'topping' or not, but likes to add it both to the bottom of the bowl and also on top of the soup after the noodles have been added.",
    "Heat comes in several forms in ramen. You can add chili oil, togarashi powder (ground Japanese chilis), or fermented pastes like Gochujang and Tobanjan.",
    "This is a standard spice blend the author uses for spicier variants of ramen.",
    "Can be used in various applications beyond ramen.",
    "Store in an airtight container to preserve freshness and potency.",
    "Adjust the proportions to your heat preference.",
    "The Sichuan peppercorns add a unique numbing sensation in addition to heat."

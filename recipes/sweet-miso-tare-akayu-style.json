  "steps": [
    "Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.",
    "Add to a nonstick skillet, and cook, over medium low heat, until the smell of alcohol evaporates, and the paste turns thicker in texture, around 15-20 minutes.",
    "Allow to cool, then transfer to a container to store in the fridge."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "The tare is a cooked miso tare, with a relatively low miso flavor as a result, the cooking process sending off volatile flavor compounds.",
    "The goal here is to cook out the alcohol, and most of the fruitiness of the miso. This is, ironically, much easier to do at home than it is in bigger quantity.",
    "Since the miso is cooked, feel free to buy sub-par miso for this. We're not as much interested in nuanced miso complexity (like we are with the more standard Miso tare).",
    "Reserve indefinitely in the fridge.",
    "Add 60 g of tare per 300 mL soup."

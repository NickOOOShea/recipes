    "Heat the contents to 71°C/160°F, hold for 10 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu and discard.",
    "Bring 82°C/180°F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes.",

  "notes": [
    "This is a variant on the Standard Shoyu Tare. For those who like those caramelized, fish forward flavors, this is a good option, as the rapid heating of the niboshi here amplifies their flavor in the final tare.",
    "Stores in the fridge for up to 6 months.",
    "Add 35 mL of tare per 350 mL soup."

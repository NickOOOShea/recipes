  "steps": [
    "The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel (technically optional, but results in whiter appearance).",
    "When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. This blanch is integral for white tonkotsu.",
    "Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid.",
    "Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate.",
    "Add your now clean bones to a pot.",
    "Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently and adding water to ensure bones are covered.",
    "Add the onion, garlic, ginger, kombu, niboshi, and katsuobushi to the soup, turning off the heat, letting it steep for one hour.",
    "Strain the soup.",
    "Add one-quarter of the soup to a blender with the gyofun and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing.",
    "Combine with the remaining soup, and reserve the soup as needed."

  "steps": [
    "Add the sake to a saucepan, and boil it vigorously for 5-10 minutes, or until the alcohol has subsided. You'll know it's close when the smell of alcohol has dissipated.",
    "Add the sake to a container to weigh it, it should weigh 360 grams. If less, add water until you get this amount.",
    "Add the remaining ingredients to this boiled sake, stirring to dissolve. If you have trouble dissolving them, add them back to the saucepan and bring up the temperature."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Created for a ramen shop where they wanted to make a tare that didn't discolor tonkotsu while still amplifying flavor.",
    "Inherently, Tonkotsu needs more heft from its tare, more salt, more sugar, and more MSG, to keep things balanced.",
    "On average, the salt content could go as 1.5 times higher in the tare.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup."

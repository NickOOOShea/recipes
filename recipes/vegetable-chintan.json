  "notes": [
    "Developed for vegan and vegetarian ramen options.",
    "Vegetarian soups lack viscosity and umami compared to meat-based soups.",
    "Umami is controlled by including Kombu (glutamic acid) and Shiitake (guanylic acid).",
    "Has a wonderful perfume but is distinctly light in texture.",
    "Pairs best with a tare that amplifies viscosity, like a Miso tare or Tantanmen tare.",

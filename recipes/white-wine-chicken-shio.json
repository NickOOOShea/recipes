    "The night before, combine the kombu, mirin, sake, and white wine in a container. Place in the fridge and steep overnight, or up to 24 hours.",
    "When ready to make the tare, place the contents of step 1 in a saucepan and heat to 71°C/160°F. Hold for 5 minutes.",
    "Remove the kombu from the liquid, add in the chicken chintan and the ground chicken. Cook, mixing frequently, at a boil until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, around 5 minutes.",
    "Strain the liquid, reserving the cooked ground chicken for another use.",
    "Place the strained liquid back into a pot and add the salt and MSG. Cook until dissolved, whisking to incorporate, around 2-3 minutes.",
    "Allow to cool, and store in the fridge."

  "notes": [
    "This recipe is heavily adapted from a shio recipe in a tare book. It's nice, very sake and wine forward, which you may or may not like.",
    "Good for particularly chicken-forward soups, but not bad in a tonkotsu either.",
    "Store in the fridge for up to 6 months.",
    "Add 30 mL of tare per 350 mL soup."

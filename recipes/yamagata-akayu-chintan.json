  "steps": [
    "Add the pork bones to a stockpot, cover with water.",
    "Bring up to a boil over high heat. When boiling, skim the scum that rises to the surface. Continue to boil until little to no scum remains, around 20 minutes.",
    "Turn the heat to low, and let the pork bones cook at a bare simmer (around 88°C/190°F), 7 hours.",
    "In the last hour, add all remaining ingredients, let steep for 1 hour at below simmer.",
    "Strain the soup and reserve until needed."

  "notes": [
    "Similar to the Eifukucho Taishoken recipe - shop dates from early 60s.",
    "Older shops use higher ratio of water to bones and heavily use fish products to provide umami.",
    "Specifically meant to be paired with other Akayu recipes.",
    "The aromatics pair nicely with a miso tare.",
    "From 'The Book of Ramen' - Chapter 2: Soup"

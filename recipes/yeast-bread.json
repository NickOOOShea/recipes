  "steps": [
    "In a large bowl, mix yeast, sugar, salt, and warm water. Let stand until yeast dissolves.",
    "Gradually add flour one cup at a time, mixing thoroughly until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.",
    "Turn dough onto a floured surface. Fold the far edge back over itself towards you. Press with heels of your hands and push away. Rotate 90° after each push. Repeat for 5 minutes, sprinkling only enough flour to prevent sticking.",
    "Let dough rest. Scrape out and grease the mixing bowl with olive oil or non-stick spray.",
    "Knead dough again for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Return dough to bowl and turn over once to grease the top. Cover with damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1-2 hours.",
    "Punch down dough and briefly knead out air bubbles. Cut in half and shape into two Italian or French-style loaves.",
    "Place loaves on a cookie sheet generously sprinkled with cornmeal. Let rest 5 minutes.",
    "Bring 4 cups (960g) water to a boil in a teakettle or pot.",
    "Slash the tops of loaves 3 or more times diagonally. Brush lightly with cold water.",
    "Place an aluminum roasting pan on the bottom of a cold oven. Fill pan with 1 inch of boiling water.",
    "Slide loaves onto baking stone in the cold oven.",
    "Bake at 400°F (205°C) for 35-45 minutes until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.",
    "Cool for at least 1 hour before slicing with a sharp serrated bread knife."

  "notes": [
    "Volume conversions: 1 tbsp yeast ≈ 9g, 1 tbsp sugar ≈ 12g, 1 tbsp salt ≈ 15g, 2 cups water ≈ 480g, 5½-6 cups flour ≈ 690g, 4 cups boiling water ≈ 960g",
    "Makes 2 loaves - can freeze one for later",
    "Alternate crustier method: Let shaped loaves rise 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 500°F with empty roasting pan for 15-30 minutes. Brush loaves with water, place in oven, pour 1 cup boiling water into pan. Bake 10 minutes at 500°F, then 10 minutes at 400°F. Cool 30 minutes before slicing.",
    "If no baking stone, use inverted cookie sheet (crust will be less crisp)"
